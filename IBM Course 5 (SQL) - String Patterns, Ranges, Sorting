--Part III: COMPOSING AND RUNNING QUERIES (Coursera Lab)
--NOTE FROM EDWARD - First few queries to pull data from table for ease of reference

select * from EMPLOYEES;
select * from DEPARTMENTS;
select * from JOBS;
select * from JOB_HISTORY;
select * from LOCATIONS
;
--Query 1: Retrieve all employees whose address is in Elgin,IL
--[Hint: Use the LIKE operator to find similar strings]
select * from EMPLOYEES  where ADDRESS like '%Elgin%';
--Query 2: Retrieve all employees who were born during the 1970's.
--[Hint: Use the LIKE operator to find similar strings]
select * from EMPLOYEES where B_DATE like '197%';
--Query 3: Retrieve all employees in department 5 whose salary is between 60000 and 70000 .
--[Hint: Use the keyword BETWEEN for this query ]
select * from EMPLOYEES where DEP_ID = 5 and SALARY between 60000 and 70000;
--Query 4A: Retrieve a list of employees ordered by department ID.
--[Hint: Use the ORDER BY clause for this query]
select * from EMPLOYEES order by DEP_ID;
--Query 4B: Retrieve a list of employees ordered in descending order by department ID and within each department ordered alphabetically in descending order by last name.
select * from EMPLOYEES order by DEP_ID desc, L_NAME desc;
--Query 5A: For each department ID retrieve the number of employees in the department.
--[Hint: Use COUNT(*) to retrieve the total count of a column, and then GROUP BY]
select DEP_ID, count(DEP_ID) as "COUNT" from EMPLOYEES group by DEP_ID; 
--Query 5B: For each department retrieve the number of employees in the department, and the average employees salary in the department.
--[Hint: Use COUNT(*) to retrieve the total count of a column, and AVG() function to compute average salaries, and then group]
select DEP_ID, count(DEP_ID) as "COUNT", avg(SALARY) as "AVERAGE_SALARY" from EMPLOYEES group by DEP_ID;
--Query 5C: Label the computed columns in the result set of Query 5B as “NUM_EMPLOYEES” and “AVG_SALARY”.
--[Hint: Use AS “LABEL_NAME” after the column name]
select DEP_ID, count(DEP_ID) as "NUM_EMPLOYEES", avg(SALARY) as "AVG_SALARY" from EMPLOYEES group by DEP_ID;
--Query 5D: In Query 5C order the result set by Average Salary.
--[Hint: Use ORDER BY after the GROUP BY]
select DEP_ID, count(DEP_ID) as "NUM_EMPLOYEES", avg(SALARY) as "AVG_SALARY" from EMPLOYEES group by DEP_ID order by AVG_SALARY;
--Query 5E: In Query 5D limit the result to departments with fewer than 4 employees.
--[Hint: Use HAVING after the GROUP BY, and use the count() function in the HAVING clause instead of the column label.
--Note: WHERE clause is used for filtering the entire result set whereas the HAVING clause is used for filtering the result of the grouping]
select DEP_ID, count(DEP_ID) as "NUM_EMPLOYEES", avg(SALARY) as "AVG_SALARY" 
from EMPLOYEES
group by DEP_ID having  count(DEP_ID)<4
order by AVG_SALARY;
--BONUS Query 6: Similar to 4B but instead of department ID use department name. Retrieve a list of employees ordered by department name, and within each department ordered alphabetically in descending order by last name.
--[Hint: Department name is in the DEPARTMENTS table. So your query will need to retrieve data from more than one table. Don’t worry if you are not able to figure this one out … we’ll cover working with multiple tables in the next lesson.] 
select * from EMPLOYEES
select DEPT_ID_DEP as DEP_ID, DEP_NAME from DEPARTMENTS
 order by DEP_Name desc, L_NAME desc;
